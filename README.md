# Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical data using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to achieve high accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used is **heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv**, which includes multiple medical parameters affecting heart health.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3. Train the model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
4. Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics.
5. Visualize risk factors using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Results
The model effectively predicts heart failure risk, achieving high accuracy and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine learning pipeline:
```bash
jupyter notebook Heart_Failure_prediction.ipynb
```
